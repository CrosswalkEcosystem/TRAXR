TRAXR is an intelligence and risk-assessment layer for XRPL liquidity.
Although the scoring engine itself is private, the public dashboard, API, and

This document explains how to request help, report issues, and understand what
kind of support TRAXR provides.

## 🚫 What TRAXR Does NOT Support

To avoid confusion, TRAXR does **not** provide support for:

- XRPL protocol or consensus issues  
- AMM-level ledger bugs  
- trustline misconfigurations  
- validator or node operations  
- wallet troubleshooting  
- custom XRPL infrastructure deployments  

TRAXR is strictly **read-only analytics**, not a validator, wallet,
or AMM protocol.
